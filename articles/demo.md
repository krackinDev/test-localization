Whenever Azure Advisor detects a new recommendation for one of your resources, an event is stored in Azure Activity log. You can set up alerts for these events from Azure Advisor using a recommendation-specific alerts creation experience. You can select a subscription and optionally a resource group to specify the resources that you want to receive alerts on.

You can also determine the types of recommendations by using these properties:
